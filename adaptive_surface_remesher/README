Remesher - Final project of Digital Geometry Processing (UBC, CPSC524)
Shayan Hoshyari

! INSTALLATION

In order to run the code CGAL and Armadillo have to be installed, and the
make has to be tweaked so that it links to them correctly. The remesher is
built via the commands:

$ make remesh METHOD=opt (optimised version)
$ make remesh (debug version)

! RUNNING

There are prepared examples of the code, they can simply executed via
running this script:

$ ./run_report_results.sh

The results will be stored in result/data. To run the remesher on any
other input use:

$ ./bin/remesh.exe.opt -i <input_file> -o <output_file>
  n_verts=<value -> number of final vertices>
  proj_type=<current, patch, plane, or sphere -> projection type>
  r_obtuse=<0 or 1 -> insertion for removing obtuse angles> 
  ttri=<value in degrees -> It is one of the angles in fidelity criteria.>
  tvert=<value in degrees -> It is one of the angles in fidelity criteria.>

The output is written in vtk file format. A .stats file is also written
which has statistics about the results.
