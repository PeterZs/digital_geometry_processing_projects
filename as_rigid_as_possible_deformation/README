--------------------  Implemented functionality:

-> Load a .off or .obj mesh.
-> Select up to 7 group of anchor vertices.
-> Rotation of each anchor group seperately.
-> Translation of each anchor group seperately.
-> Implemented method: ARAP with weak constraints for the anchor vertices.
-> Solver: PETSc (https://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/)
           Supports Cholesky, LU, GMRES, BCGSTAB and CG
	   (preconditioned with ILU(k), or incomplete Cholesky)
-> Dense Matrix Library: Armadillo (http://arma.sourceforge.net/)	   

-------------------- How to use the code:

Modify the makefile and run (PETSc and Armadillo must be installed):
$ make GLUT

To run the code:
$ ./mview <mesh_file_address> [options]

Where options can be any Petsc options, e.g.:
-ksp_type (cholesky, lu, ...)

And the following options for the ARAP class:
-arap_v (0, 1, or 2) verbosity of the ARAP class, default: 2
-arap_beta (weight)  weight for the anchor vertex constraints, default: 10
-arap_uni_wgt        use uniform weights instead of the cotan weights,
                     default: false
-arap_tol            tolerance for the nonlinear solver, default: 5.e-3

-------------------- Code Structure:

mathvector/*

Is part of the original Mesh Viewer code. I did not write this. Has basic
support for three-dimensional vectors.

glut/*

The GUI code. This was orignaly here, but I modified it extensively to add
support for vertex selection, movement and rotation.

mesh/*

My main contribution to this code was the arap.h and arap.cpp classes.
They contain the class Deformation which is responsible for deforming
a mesh.
