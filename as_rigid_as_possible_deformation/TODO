This is a very much incomplete list of possible Mesh Viewer improvements:

 - cmake support
 - saving of viewpoints (for example in VRML97 files)
 - better Web3D/VRML97 support (e.g. "def" and "use" support)
 - making it more configurable
 - supporting more 3D file formats (X3D, PLY binary format, Quake player models etc.)
